# BerlinMumsLearnToCode
### A collection of coding resources

A list of resources for Berlin mums wanting to join
the tech side and learn programming.

Hi everyone! I will try to explain all the possibilities here.
I will stick to free and community led options. 

Let's start with the mentorship programs!
We'll dive into the Berlin learning meetups and groups
right after.
I will also share some other resources that can get you
free conference tickets etc. at the end.

#### Learn it, Girl

Links: https://www.learnitgirl.com/,
https://www.facebook.com/learnitgirl  
A global free program where you sign up and you
get a personal mentor that will guide you and work
with you for 3 months. 
You can pick a project and a programming language if
you have an idea for it,
or if you don't know where to start, they will
help you out! Just reach out.
I have coached a person that I met trough this
programme that after got her first job as a 
programmer.
So proud of her and you can do it too!

#### Ampair
Link: https://ampair.io/  
Another program where you can sign up and get a
free guidance from a mentor
for 3 months.
Open to all levels, beginner and up.
Here instead of having a mentor assigned, you pick your mentor.

You can also spend a couple of months learning and being mentored
and get paid for it! The following programs are aimed at 
women, but all of them require a bit of knowledge.
It is good to have them in mind as a next step after you get a bit
(or a bit more) grip on all the techy stuff you will be learning:

#### Rails Girls Summer of Code
Link: https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/  
You apply as an individual or a team and you get paid to learn
and make for 3 months.
You need to have finished a workshop (like the ones
I will list soon!) or have been learning for yourself
for about a year.
It is run by the Berlin based Travis foundation:
https://foundation.travis-ci.org/. 

#### Outreachy
Link: https://www.outreachy.org/  
A paid learning and making program.
You will be contributing to world renoun projects through it.
It is a bit more competitive and this one requires a little bit
more knowledge.
Great to keep an eye on for later and have it as a goal
as this is job landing material.
I was part of the program 10 years ago and was
a big door opener for me.

#### Berlin meetups and learning groups.
There are many Berlin meetups and learning groups
that are safe spaces,
created for and run by women, where you can learn and 
socialise in an comfortable environment.
A big drawback is that many of the regular meetups
are starting at 19:00, or as we 
mothers know it - bedtime.

#### CodeCurious (previously "Rails Girls Berlin")
Link: http://railsgirlsberlin.de/  
Free workshops for women with no prior experience in programming.
The workshops focus on the Ruby on Rails framework and you 
can learn how to make a full website from the ground up on the day.
They help you get organised in project groups to continue 
learning after. Really awesome people <3

#### Django Girls Berlin
Link: https://djangogirls.org/berlin/  
Same as the previous group, but they focus on the Django
framework and the Python language. 

#### ClojureBridge Berlin
Link: https://clojurebridge-berlin.org/  
Same as the previous two, but focusing on the
Clojure language.
I've mentored in this workshop and oh boy is this fun!
Look what you can do after(ok or close to it ^^):

#### CodeBar
Link: https://codebar.io/berlin  
Same as the previous workshops, focuses on HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and Ruby.
You can look at their tutorials here:
http://tutorials.codebar.io/

#### PyLadies Berlin
Link: http://berlin.pyladies.com/  
In their own words: "PyLadies aims to provide a
friendly support network for women and a bridge
to the larger Python world." 
They organise monthly meetups consisting of a
short talk and a workshop.
There are many experienced people there that will help
you out and answer all of your questions.
Don't be afraid to show up!
I am a serious fan of this crowd and I hope to speak 
there again sometime.

#### Women who Go
Links: https://www.womenwhogo.org/,
https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Go-Berlin/  
A study group for women that want to learn the Go language.
It is enough to have some interest (and absolutely no experience)
to join in.
There will be other women to support you there! 

#### Women who Code Berlin
Link: https://www.womenwhocode.com/berlin  
You can find all kinds of talks and workshops during their meetups.
Only women are speaking so it's super inspiring!
It is a friendly atmosphere where you could meet many like-minded
women on the same journey as you, and get acquainted with new 
and exciting things happening in the world of code.
Hack nights are organised regularly where you
can dive in into something and ask questions.

#### Women Techmakers Berlin
Link: http://wtmberlin.com/  
Same as the meetup above!
They organised a special "Parents in Tech" meetup a while ago,
and I took my little guy there <3

#### Open Tech School
Link: http://www.opentechschool.org/berlin/  
Now this is a serious gem.
There are so many learning groups you can join!
Check out the events list on the website.
I have coached in the Python group when I moved to Berlin.
The format is so: there are learners and experienced coaches.
There are already tutorials you can pick to work on and the coaches
will support you through it day-by-day as you return, or you can 
pick a project of your on, as long as it fits the learning group.
You can also show up and say: Hey! I know nothing about this
cool thing you are doing, but I really want to learn please!
You will be helped.
These groups are so awesome as you can grow endlessly there - from
the basic tutorials, to your first real big project and beyond.
Step by step, supported.

#### Heart of Code
Link: http://heartofcode.org/  
A hackerspace for women. They offer different workshops,
events and a warm community.
Upcoming events:

#### Geekettes
Link: http://www.geekettes.io/  
A warm community for all kinds of women in tech.
You won't necessarily find a lot of programming
themed workshops, but it's a great meeting point
for looking beyond the specifics
of a job and scouting for new opportunities, getting
contacts in the entrepreneurship scene in Berlin,
landing a job, etc.
If you request membership you get added to a very
vibrant Facebook group that's worth filling the form.
Geekettes was the first organisation I joined when I moved to Berlin
and they helped me find a job by publishing this:

Absolutely grateful forever!


### Final takeaway

I am sure all of this looks a bit daunting.
I really recommend signing up to a RailsGirls or DjangoGirls
or any similar workshop and start from there.
Learning alone is tough.
Join facebook groups, meet people in real life if you are lucky, 
show up at some of the meetups if the time and
circumstances permit that. 

Go places you deserve it!
You can apply for free conference tickets here:

Some unconventional learning resources:
- These are some very nicely explained computer concepts.
  Also very very pretty.
  You won't regret clicking or reading: https://shop.bubblesort.io/
- I love Julia Evan's learning zines: https://wizardzines.com/.
  This one about the joy of learning is so on spot and 
  you want to read it: https://jvns.ca/wizard-zine.pdf

I will stop here because there is a endless list of these.
Just wanted to show you how beautiful and approachable learning 
computers is when made by other women!
It doesn't have to be dry and scary.
You can do this.
